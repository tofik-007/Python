Python supports four different numerical types −

int (signed integers) − They are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.

long (long integers ) − Also called longs, they are integers of unlimited size, written like integers and followed by an uppercase or lowercase L.

float (floating point real values) − Also called floats, they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.
Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).

complex (complex numbers) − are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number).
The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.

Python allows you to use a lowercase L with long, but it is recommended that you use only an uppercase L to avoid confusion with the number 1.
Python displays long integers with an uppercase L.

A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating point numbers denoted by a + bj, 
where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part of the complex number.
